## Live Document with Possible Next Steps

***

- [] Split data into training and test subsets
- [] Write scripts with Keras functions to load the datasets and perform online data augmentation
- [] Calculate the image complexity of each image on all dataset as measured by the MSE between the original image and its JPEG compressed version
- [] Design a CAE architecture with appropriate complexity and use Bayesian search to optimize hyperparameters (and possibly depth)
- [] Calculate the reconstruction error of each image on the test set using the optimized CAE
